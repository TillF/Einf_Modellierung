task_name: x3_interpolation

description: >
A biologist attached a sensor to a whale to track the distance it covers. Whenever there is radio and GPS coverage (e.g. the whale reaches the surface), the sensor transmits the time and the total cumulated distance so far. 
Estimate the covered distance for a point in time between sensor records by linear interpolation (rounded to one digit)!

#### Example
For the times `[0, 1, 2.5]` the sensor yielded the distances `[0, 30, 45]`. Consequently, for times `[0.5, 1]` the whale's swimming distance can be approximated with `[15, 30]`.
#### Input / Output   

   
input1:
	name: t_meas	
	type: array.float
	description: Times when the position (i.e. covered distance) was recorded.

input2:
	name: x_meas
	type: array.float
	description: Covered distance for `t_meas`

input3:
	name: t_approx	
	type: array.float
	description: Points in time, for which the position is to be approximated.
	
output:
	type: array.float
	description: Approximated distance for `t_approx`, rounded to one digit.
