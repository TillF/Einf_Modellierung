task_name: x6_heat_periods

description: >
   A heat period is defined by at least `thresh_length` consecutive days with mean daily temperatures exceeding `thresh_temp`.
   
   How many heat periods are contained in the time series of mean daily temperatures `timeseries_temp` ?  
   
   #### Example
   For `timeseries_temp = c(19, 23, 24, 18, 19, 21)`, `thresh_temp = 20` and `thresh_length = 2`, `1` heat period can be discerned.
   #### Input / Output 
input1:
   name: timeseries_temp
   type: array.float
   description: time series of mean daily temperatures.

input2:
   name: thresh_temp
   type: float
   description: temperatur threshold, that must be exceeded.

input3:
   name: thresh_length
   type: integer
   description: threshold for minimum number of consecutive days, the threshold temperature must be exceeded.

output:
   name: n_h
   type: integer
   description: Number of heat periods in given time series.
