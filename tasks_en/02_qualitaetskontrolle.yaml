task_name: quality_check

description: >
	`precip` is a vector of daily precipitation (in mm). 
	You know that the raingauge was malfunctioning on certain days contained in the
	vector `error_days`. 
	Replace all faulty measurements with *-9999* and return the corrected vector.
	
	#### Example
	
	For `precip = c(1, 5.5, 10.1, 0, 3)` and `error_days = c(2, 4)`,
	the result should be `[1, -9999, 10.1, -9999, 3]`.
    
input1:
	name: precip
	type: array.float
	description: vector of daily precipitation (in mm) 

input2:
	name: error_days
	type: array.integer
	description: vector indicating the days of intrument failure 

output:
	type: array.float
	description: vector of daily precipitation with erroneous values masked

test1:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [1,2]
	output: [-9999, -9999, 3, 4, 5, 6]

test2:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [4,5]
	output: [1, 2, 3, -9999, -9999, 6]

test3:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [1,3,6]
	output: [-9999, 2, -9999, 4, 5, -9999]

solution: |
	quality_check = function(precip, error_days) {
	  precip[error_days] = -9999
	  return(precip)
	}
