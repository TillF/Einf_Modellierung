description: >
	**Replace elements of a vector**
    `precip` is a vector of daily precipitation (in mm). You know that the rain gauge was malfunctioning on certain days contained in the vector `error_days`. Replace all faulty measurements with `-9999` and return the corrected vector.
    
    **Attention:** `error_days` specifies a the position in a time series. In many languages such as R, you can use it directly as an index vector. In other languages such as C or Python, you need to be aware that the first element of a vector is indexed by `0`. So day `4` e.g. corresponds to index `3`.
    
    **Attention R-users:** The concept of a list in R is different from languages such as Python. In order to make this work here, you need to first `unlist` any required input vector `v`.
    
    ```
        v = unlist(v)
    ```
    #### Example
    
    For `precip = [1, 5.5, 10.1, 0, 3]` and `error_days = [2, 4]`, the result should be `[1, -9999, 10.1, -9999, 3]`.
    
input1:
	name: precip
	type: array.float
	description: vector of daily precipitation (in mm) 

input2:
	name: error_days
	type: array.integer
	description: vector indicating the days of intrument failure 

output:
	type: array.float
	description: vector of daily precipitation with erroneous values masked

test1:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [1,2]
	output: [-9999, -9999, 3, 4, 5, 6]

test2:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [4,5]
	output: [1, 2, 3, -9999, -9999, 6]

test3:
	input:
	- [1,2,3,4,5,6]
	- [1,3,6]
	output: [-9999, 2, -9999, 4, 5, -9999]

solution: |
	x2_quality_check = function(precip, error_days) {
	  precip = unlist(precip)
      error_days = unlist(error_days)
      precip[error_days] = -9999
	  return(precip)
	}
